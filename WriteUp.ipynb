    "    \n",
    "Based on the description of http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/publis/pdf/sermanet-ijcnn-11.pdf I wanted to understand the impact of gray scale versus Y extraction out of YUV.\n",

    "* Each layer should be wired to different convolutional networks (U and V require simpler networks than Y)\n",
    "* Accumulate (inception) all resultes before the last 2 (or 3) fully connected neuronal network stages.\n",
    "\n",
    "I was wondering as well whether croping out the unrelevant parts of the image would help the neuronal network to better predict an image type.\n",

    "Thus for each image I created 8 augmented ones to allow the network learn more:\n",
    "* Shift top left bottom right making sure the coords defining the 'coords' value of the image keeps visible\n",
    "    * The idea is to make sure the network is not only able to learn some part of the image cropping out borders.\n",
    "* Created 4 images with following rotations in degrees: -15, -5, 5, 15\n",
    "    * The idea is to make sure the network does not learn the angle of the image: it should be able to recognize an image independantly of its rotation.\n",
    "* Created a new blur image\n",
    "    * Some images might be clear other less clear, with this we want the network to learn unclear images.\n",
    "* Increased brightness of the image\n",
    "    * Some images might be suffering of sun refelection we simulate such a case with this data augmentation.\n",
